## ChatBot

This is a basic implementation of a chatbot using Python. The chatbot can learn new questions and answers from user interactions and store them in a JSON file




## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zihaarn/chat-bot.git
    cd chat-bot
    ```

2. Run the chatbot:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the chatbot.

4. To stop the application, type 'quit' as the user input.

### File Structure

- `main.py`: Backend code, including chatbot logic.
- `knowledge_base.json`: JSON file serving as the data store for questions and answers.

### Acknowledgments

- The chatbot logic is based on the difflib library for string matching.

Feel free to customize and extend this chatbot for your specific needs. Contributions are welcome!
